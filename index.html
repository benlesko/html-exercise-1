            <h3>Top 3 cities I'd like to visit</h3>
            <ol>
                <strong><li>Seoul, Korea</li></strong>
                <em><li>Oslo, Norway</li></em>
                <strong><li>Tokyo, Japan</li></strong>
            </ol>
            <p>I am currently learning Korean and would love to travel to Seoul to experience the country.
            As for Oslo, I just think the country is beautiful and would like to experience it in person.
            Tokyo is my final pick - I learned a bit of Japanese in college and still have a lot of interest
            in seeing the country for myself.
